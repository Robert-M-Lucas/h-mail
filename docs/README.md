The generated documentation (in the `generated` folder) describes the JSON API.

Note that though this documentation covers all requests supported by the example server implementation, only the `foreign` routes (in `generated/routes/foreign`, as described in [General Communication Flow](Flows/General%20Communication%20Flow.md)) need to be implemented for a server to be compatible with other h-mail servers. With all routes correctly implemented, a server/client will be compatible with the reference client/server.
