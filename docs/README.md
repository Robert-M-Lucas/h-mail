The generated documentation (in the `generated` folder) describes the API.

Note that though this documentation covers all requests supported by the example server implementation, only the `foreign` routes (those beginning with `/foreign/` in [All Routes](All%20Routes.md)) need to be implemented for a server to be compatible with other h-mail servers. With all routes correctly implemented, a server/client will be compatible with the reference client/server.
